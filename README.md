## Smart LEDs controlled by a Raspberry PI and a NodeJS Webserver

This is a small project I did for a non-profit to display as part of their Stranger Things / 80's themed gala.

The lights I used are these:

I don't think it really matters 5v or 12v as you get a proper external power supply for the LEDs. You could probably power 
some 5v LEDS off of the Pi but I wouldn't. I had a power supply laying around but I'm sure you can find some 5v or 12v 10A 
power supply on Amazon.
